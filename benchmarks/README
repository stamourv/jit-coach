Benchmarks to measure the effectiveness of the JIT coach's recommendations.

Uses some of the Octane benchmarks [TODO link] (not all make sense for us).

Also reuses part of the Octane infrastructure for benchmarking.

Kept in a separate repo from the coach to avoid any licencing issues.


To run:
- raco pkg install benchmark
- racket bench.rkt
- open plot.pdf


Notes:
- because multiple versions of the same benchmark exist, they must use the
  module pattern to avoid conflicting. That seems to add some overhead (i.e.
  it reduces scores a bit), but that should be consistent across versions.
