Benchmarks to measure the effectiveness of the JIT coach's recommendations.

Uses some of the Octane benchmarks [TODO link] (not all make sense for us).

Also reuses part of the Octane infrastructure for benchmarking.

Kept in a separate repo from the coach to avoid any licencing issues.


To run:
- raco pkg install benchmark
- racket bench.rkt
- open plot.pdf


Versions summary:
Richards: 1- baseline
          2- fixed location for TaskControlBlock.state
          3- remove packet queue flip-flopping
DeltaBlue: 1- baseline
           2- singleton Direction -> globals
           3- singleton Strength -> globals
RayTrace: 1- baseline
          2- IntersectionInfo w/o class system
          3- IntersectionInfo.isHit on object
          4- reordered Material fields
          5- #2 + #4


Notes:
- because multiple versions of the same benchmark exist, they must use the
  module pattern to avoid conflicting. That seems to add some overhead (i.e.
  it reduces scores a bit), but that should be consistent across versions.
